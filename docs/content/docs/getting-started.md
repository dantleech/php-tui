# Getting Started

Let's render a map _of the world_.

First create a new project:

```shell
mkdir tui-demo
cd tui-demo
```

and require the `php-tui` package:

```
composer require phptui/php-tui
```

Now create the file `map.php` with the following content:

{{% include file="/data/example/getting-started/map.php" language="php" %}}
